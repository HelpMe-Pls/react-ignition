# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# What I've Learnt
## Introduction to React:
– React
    • create-react-app bootstraps a React application
    * JSX mixes up HTML and JavaScript to define the output of React components in their render methods
    • components, instances and elements are different things in React
    • ReactDOM.render() is an entry point for a React application to hook React into the DOM
    • built-in JavaScript functionalities can be used in JSX
    * map can be used to render a list of items as HTML elements

• ES6
    • variable declarations with const and let can be used for specific use cases
    * use const over let in React applications
    • arrow functions can be used to keep your functions concise
    • classes are used to define components in React by extending them

----------o0o----------

## Basics in React:
– React
    **use this.state and setState() to manage your internal component state**
    • pass functions or class methods to your element handler
    • use forms and events in React to add interactions
    * unidirectional data flow is an important concept in React
    • embrace controlled components
    • compose components with children and reusable components
    * usage and implementation of ES6 class components and functional stateless components
• approaches to style your components

– ES6
    • functions that are bound to a class are class methods
    **destructuring of objects and arrays**
    • default parameters

• General
    • higher-order functions

----------o0o----------

## API interactions:
– React
    * ES6 class component lifecycle methods for different use cases
    • componentDidMount() for API interactions
    * conditional renderings
    • synthetic events on forms {preventDefault()}
    • error handling
    • aborting a remote API request

– ES6 and beyond
    • template strings to compose strings
    * spread operator for immutable data structures
    **computed property names**
    • class fields

– General
    • Hacker News API interaction
    • native fetch browser API
    • client- and server-side search
    * pagination of data
    * client-side caching
    • axios as an alternative for the native fetch API

----------o0o----------

## Advanced React Components:
– React
    • the ref attribute to reference DOM nodes
    **higher-order components are a common way to build advanced components**
    • implementation of advanced interactions in React
    • conditional classNames with a neat helper library

– ES6
    * rest destructuring to split up objects and arrays

----------o0o----------

## State Management:
– React
    • lift state management up and down to suitable components
    **setState can use a function to prevent stale state bugs**
    • existing external solutions (Redux or MobX) that help you to tame the state, read more about them
